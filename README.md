# stuw81300

This is an `embedded-hal` crate for the (STuW81300)[https://www.st.com/en/wireless-connectivity/stuw81300.html] integrated VCO/PLL chip.
Eventually I hope to cover the entire capabilities of the chip as a nice example of a complicated embedded-hal SPI driver.

# Not yet implemented

- Charge pump leakage current
